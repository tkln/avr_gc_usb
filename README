GameCube controller USB adapter firmware

Build dependencies:

- avr-gcc
- avr-libc
- avrdude

Building and flashing:

$ make
$ make flash 

The Makefile assumes by default atmega32u4 with avr109 bootloader
at /dev/ttyACM0. These can be modified by setting the MCU,
PROGRAMMER and PORT variables accordingly.

Notes on compatibility:

The device has been successfully tested with Linux. It probably won't
work on Windows, because I think Windows requires USB devices to have
valid vendor and product ids. It should work once the placeholder ids
are replaced.
